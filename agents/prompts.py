Strong execution requires strong fundamentals...so you're not wasting time by reviewing the basics.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that enhances reasoning in large language models by guiding them to generate intermediate logical steps before providing final answers. It's most effective for complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, particularly in models with over 100 billion parameters. Use CoT when dealing with mathematical problems, symbolic manipulation, or complex reasoning tasks where step-by-step thinking would be beneficial.

üåê Exploring Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns üåê
Multi-agent systems break down complex applications into smaller, specialized agents, offering modularity, specialization, and control. Key architecture patterns include:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Network: Agents communicate freely, ideal for non-hierarchical tasks.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Supervisor: A central agent directs others, enabling structured workflows.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Hierarchical: Supervisors manage teams of agents, scaling complexity.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Workflows: Predefined or dynamic agent sequences for tailored solutions.

You are an AI assistant tasked with routing a user's response to one of two possible routes based on their intention. The two possible routes are:

1. Rewrite post - The user's response indicates they want to rewrite the generated post.
2. Update scheduled date - The user wants to update the scheduled date for the post. This can either be a new date or a priority level (P1, P2, P3).

Here is the generated post:
<post>
{post}
</post>

Here is the current date/priority level for scheduling the post:
<date-or-priority>
{date_or_priority}
</date-or-priority>

Carefully analyze the user's response:
<user-response>
{user_response}
</user-response>

Based on the user's response, determine which of the two routes they intend to take. Consider the following:

1. If the user mentions editing, changing, or rewriting the content of the post, choose the "rewrite_post" route.
2. If the user mentions changing the date, time, or priority level of the post, choose the "update_date" route. Ensure you only call this if the user mentions a date, or one of P1, P2 or P3.

If the user's response can not be handled by one of the two routes, choose the "unknown_response" route.

Provide your answer in the following format:
<explanation>

Route: rewrite_post
Explanation: The user is requesting changes to the content of the post.

Example 2:
User: "Schedule this for next Tuesday."
Route: update_date
Explanation: The user wants to change the posting date.

Example 3:
User: "This should be a P1 priority."
Route: update_date
Explanation: The user wants to change the priority level of the post.

Example 4:
User: "This should be a P0 priority."
Route: unknown_response
Explanation: P0 is not a valid priority level.

Example 5:

<post>

Now, review the marketing report that was used to generate this post:

1. Does the image directly illustrate a key point or theme from the post?
2. Does the image represent any products, services, or concepts mentioned in either the post or the report?

You should NEVER include images which are:
- Personal, or non-essential images from a business perspective.
- Small, low-resolution images. These are likely accidentally included in the post and should be excluded.

1. <analysis> tag: Briefly explain your thought process for each image, referencing specific elements from the post and report.
2. <relevant_indices> tag: List the indices of the relevant images, starting from 0, separated by commas.
