I get many texts and DMs about jobs for extra money. They seemed suspicious, and now the scam is clear. These scams promise easy earnings but lead to over $220 million in losses this year alone. Scammers lure victims with small payments, then ask for deposits to "unlock" earnings. This isn't just a financial issue; it's a growing threat to our digital safety. How can we combat these scams and protect ourselves? Share your thoughts in the comments!

As reliance on AI for coding grows, understanding these risks is vital for protecting sensitive information and upholding ethical standards.\n\nüí° How can we enhance security in AI-driven development?
